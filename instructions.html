    <ul>
        <li>If <strong>matching numbers</strong> are rolled on the <strong>D20</strong>, <strong>D8</strong>, or <strong>D12</strong>, roll <strong>D8</strong> again and add that result to the room encounter.</li>
        <li>If all three (<strong>D20</strong>, <strong>D8</strong>, and <strong>D12</strong>) match, roll the <strong>D8</strong> three times and add all results to the encounter.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Progressing Through the Dungeon</h3>
    <p>Choose an exit and repeat the steps, drawing hallways and rooms based on the dice rolls. Avoid placing doors at the edge of the map; treat them as solid walls.</p>

    <h3>Ending the Game</h3>
    <p>The game ends when the entire grid is filled, a major objective is completed, or players decide to end the session.</p>
