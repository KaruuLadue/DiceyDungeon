# Dicey Dungeon
Dicey Dungeon is a web-based tool designed to generate randomized dungeon scenarios using the full set of Dungeons & Dragons dice. Players can roll dice to determine hallway lengths, room encounters, modifiers, and more, allowing for a dynamic and unpredictable dungeon-crawling experience.

## Features
- Roll all standard DnD dice to generate dungeon layouts and room features.
- Customize roll tables for each die to suit your own adventure.
- Export roll history to a text file for easy session record-keeping.
- Save custom roll tables to local storage for personalized play.
- Animated dice results with an optional matching number highlight.
- Simple and user-friendly interface for an easy dungeon-building experience.

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/DiceyDungeon.git
```

Then, navigate into the project directory:

```sh
cd DiceyDungeon
```

## Usage
To run Dicey Dungeon:
1. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser.
2. Click **Roll** to generate a dungeon section. The results will be displayed, with all relevant dice rolls.
